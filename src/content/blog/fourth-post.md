**The Year 2125: A Forgotten Legacy**  

A hundred years from now, in 2125, we will all be gone—along with our families, our friends, and everyone we hold dear. Strangers will walk through our homes, own the things we tirelessly worked for, and live in the world we once called ours. Even our descendants, the ones we imagined carrying our legacy, will barely remember our names. The photos we took, the stories we told, the achievements we prided ourselves on—all will fade into oblivion, erased by time.  

And when we begin to see life from this perspective, we realize how fleeting our existence truly is. We chase wealth, success, and recognition, believing they define us. But in the end, what do they really mean? We spend our days striving for more—more money, more status, more possessions—while the things that truly matter slip away.  

The time to mend broken relationships.  
The time to say a heartfelt goodbye.  
The time to pause and acknowledge how small we are in the vastness of time.  

Because, in the end, what did we truly know?  

May or may not happen tomorrow...  
**(कल हो ना हो)**

### **Stay Happy Stay Blessed!**
